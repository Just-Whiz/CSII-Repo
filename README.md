# CSII-Repo
CS 2 work and references for all future projects from 2023-2024

This will be a digital repository of all the projects and assignments given to me during CS II that spanned the entirety of my sophomore year of high school. I'll also add some passion projects I'm proud of in a seperate folder.

Independent projects will also be stored in a seperate folder.
Independent Intersession projects will be stored in a subsection in this folder documenting my experiences.


If future me is reading this, I hope things got better.
